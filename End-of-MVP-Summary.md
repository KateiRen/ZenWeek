## 2. PRD Requirements Coverage (vs. InitialAnalysis.md)

| Feature                                 | Initial Status | Current Status | Notes |
|------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Add/edit/delete tasks for each day       | ✅            | ✅            | Fully implemented |
| Drag-and-drop tasks between days         | ✅ (inline JS) | ✅ (modular)  | Now in static/dragdrop.js |
| Persistent storage (SQLite)              | ✅            | ✅            | |
| Basic code documentation                 | ❌            | ✅            | Docstrings and comments added |
| 4–6 unit tests                          | ❌            | ✅            | 5+ tests in tests/test_app.py |
| Analyze code and suggest improvements    | ⚠️            | ✅            | Addressed in To-Do.md and this summary |
| Improve drag-and-drop                    | ⚠️            | ✅            | Modularized, improved UI |
| Automated DB backups                     | ❌            | ✅            | backup_restore.py, weekly auto-backup |
| Weekly summary view                      | ❌            | ✅            | summary.html, charts, open/overdue tasks |

## 3. Coding Best Practices Review

### Strengths (Now)
- Modular code: Flask app, config, backup, and JS are separated
- All SQL queries parameterized (prevents SQL injection)
- Docstrings and inline comments throughout
- Error handling for DB and user input in all routes
- requirements.txt and .gitignore present
- Linter config (.flake8) and code style improved
- Unit tests for core routes and DB logic (pytest)
- CI config for lint/test automation (GitHub Actions)
- Static analysis and code review via To-Do.md
- UI/UX: Bootstrap, responsive, badge toggle, week styling, auto-focus, consistent card heights
- Automated weekly DB backups, backup/restore script
- Weekly summary page with open/overdue tasks, charts, and action buttons
- Hyperlink icon and embedded link for tasks with URLs in summary

### Issues & Risks (Now)
- Some inline CSS in summary.html (minor linter warning)
- No end-to-end or browser-based UI tests (only Flask/DB unit tests)
- Drag-and-drop could be further improved for accessibility and edge cases
- No user authentication (all users share the same DB)
- No internationalization (i18n) or language toggle
- No dark mode or advanced theming
- No mobile-specific UI optimizations (though responsive)
- No advanced reporting/export features

---

## 4. Recommendations & Next Steps
- Refactor inline CSS in summary.html to static/style.css
- Add more tests: edge cases, drag-and-drop, and UI (e.g., Selenium)
- Consider user authentication for multi-user support
- Add i18n support for multiple languages
- Explore dark mode and further UI polish
- Add export/reporting features (CSV, PDF)
- Continue to track improvements in To-Do.md
