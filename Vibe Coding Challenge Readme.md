## Step 1. Idea Generation
https://skilluplabforhackathon.azurewebsites.net/ptpchallenge/ptp-ideation


Prompt

I am participating in a creative Prompt to Prototype challenge where the end goal is to build a web-based prototype in 4 modules:

1. Research
2. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
3. Branding & Logo
4. Prototype

Here is my idea: I once built a web based weekly planner that helps to easily create and move tasks across days of a week. The project is based on Python and Flask while using also Javascript for frontend functionality. The basic functionality is there but I always wished for advanced features like a summary list of tasks, a diagram with tasks by week and an indicator for open tasks on each weeks tab.

Please help me scope it by filling out the following details:
- Scenario (theme or context)
- Audience (target users)
- Vibe Words (2–3 adjectives for style and tone)
- Format (type of web experience — app, game, dashboard, interactive toy, quiz etc.)
- Concept (short description)
- Goal (what it aims to achieve)
- Title (placeholder name)
- MVP Features (small, completable in &lt;2 hours)
- Stretch Goals (2–3 enhancements)

Output the result in a table with these columns: Scenario | Audience | Vibe Words | Format | Concept | Goal | Title | MVP Features | Stretch Goals.

We will work on the scenario called ZenWeek.Draft a short compelling pitch for this idea. Make it clear and concise.

SCOPE RULES (BEGINNER, LOW-COMPLEXITY):
- Keep ideas buildable as a single-page front-end (no auth, no external APIs, minimal state).
- If suggesting competitors/inspiration, prefer products that can be emulated without backends or complex data.

RESEARCH MODE:
- If browsing is available, use recent, credible sources. Prefer official docs, reputable media, or case studies.
- For every factual claim, include a source title + link + month/year. If uncertain, label as “emerging/unclear”.

TASKS (KEEP IT TIGHT):
1) Trends / Facts — 5 concise items relevant to the domain AND the chosen lightweight web app.
 Columns: Claim | Why it matters | Source | Date (MM/YYYY)
2) Competitors — 3–5 direct or analogous products.
Columns: Name/Link | What it is | Engagement hook | What they do well | Note for us (beginner-feasible twist)
• At least 1 should match our lightweight web app; at least 1 can be an adjacent inspiration.
3) Audience Insights — 3 items.
 Columns: Need/Behavior | Why it happens | Implication for our MVP
4) Differentiators*— 3–5 crisp options that fit beginner constraints.
Columns: Differentiator | How it helps | 1-line build hint (front-end only)
5) Alternative Vibe Words — 3–5 options.
Columns: Word | Tone cue | Quick UI cue (color/type/layout)

QUALITY CHECK (do silently before output):
- No claims without a source if you used the web. If no good source, mark “emerging/unclear”.
- Avoid suggestions that require servers, auth, or complex data.
- Keep each cell ≤ ~18 words.

OUTPUT FORMAT (return ONLY these five tables, in order, no extra text):
- Trends / Facts
- Competitors
- Audience Insights
- Differentiators
- Alternative Vibe Words

## Step 3. Brand and Identity

Prompt

Create a brand identity for my project.

Please provide:
1. 3 possible tagline options.
2. A suggested color palette (with hex codes) that matches my vibe words.
3. A short style description for use in design tools (e.g., “Bold geometric shapes with bright gradients”).
4. A text prompt I can use to generate a simple, scalable logo with a transparent background.

Keep everything simple enough to create and apply within a 1-hour workshop build.

✅ 4. Logo Generation Prompt
Use this text in an AI image generator (e.g., DALL·E, Midjourney, Figma plugin):
Prompt:
"Minimal flat logo for a productivity app called ZenWeek. Concept: a simple calendar icon with a soft checkmark inside, rounded corners, calm blue and mint color palette, clean and modern design, no text, transparent background, scalable vector style."


## Step 4. Product Requirements

Prompt

I am creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for my project ZenWeek.

Please create a short lightweight PRD that includes:
1. Vision & Objectives (1–2 sentences)
2. User Stories (3–5 stories in the format “As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]”)
3. Feature List (separating MVP from nice-to-have/stretch goals)
4. Success Metrics (how we’ll know it’s working)
5. Constraints or Assumptions

Keep it concise and scoped so the MVP can be built in under 1 hour. Export the PRD as a markdown file.


Prompt

Based on my PRD, create an image of a simple mockup of the main or starting screen.


## Step 5. Select Prototype Approach

## Step 6. Option B - Code Prototyping

**When finished - come back here and create  a new version from scratch and maybe even Node.js**


## My custom steps

prompt
Analyze the existing codebase (app.py is the python flask app, prod.sqlite3 is the database, templates contains the html and javascript code) against the ZenWeek_PRD.md specifications and against coding best practices. Create an InitialAnalysis.md to capture your findings and identified steps needed to get to the MVP and adhere to best practices.
